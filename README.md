# Application-of-Data-Governance

Welcome to the Future Shoppers Superstore Data Governance Project! In this repository, we delve into the application of the DAMA-DMBOK Data Governance framework within the dynamic landscape of the ecommerce industry. Focused on three core Data Governance sub-domains—Data Quality, Data Modeling and Design, and Data Integration and Interoperability—we've developed comprehensive sample policies and procedures.

Our project extends beyond theoretical frameworks; we've conducted thorough analyses, generated strategic plans, and crafted models for the effective management of the superstore's database. Additionally, we've prepared two insightful reports—an Operational report and an Executive report—to empower Regional Managers and the Chief Operating Officer of Future Shoppers Superstore in informed decision-making. Explore our repository to uncover the insights and strategies driving effective data governance in the ecommerce realm.
